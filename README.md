# Fitness Quiz
Welcome to my fitness quiz. This is a 5 question quiz about some basic resistance lifts. Each question will have 4 answers to choose from. Choose the right one and the time will increasse by 10 seconds. Choose wrong and it will decrease by 10 seconds. The score will be scored by how many seconds it takes for you to complete it. If the time goes to 0 while you're still answering a question, that means you fail!

You can try it here!
